## SQL Analytical Techniques Used

This project demonstrates SQL techniques used for real-world data analysis on two datasets:
1. Pizza Sales Data
2. Hospital Patient Data

Techniques Included:
• JOINs — to combine tables and get relational insights
• GROUP BY — to aggregate metrics such as revenue and patient count
• Aggregations — SUM, COUNT, AVG for KPI calculations
• Window Functions — RANK, ROW_NUMBER, SUM OVER for comparative and time-based insights
• Filtering & Conditions — WHERE, HAVING for slicing data
• Ordering — ORDER BY to sort results
• Date Functions — to derive month, day and time insights

Project 1: Pizza Sales Analysis 

KPIs:
• Total Revenue = 871.86k
• Quantity Sold = 49574
• Average pizza per order =2.32 
• Total orders= 21350

Insights:
• Classic pizzas were top-selling category
• Peak sales during evening time
• Highest revenue on Fridays and Saturday





Project 2 : Hospital Patient data 

•	Performed data extraction and analysis on hospital datasets using SQL queries, joins, subqueries, and aggregation functions.

•	Created KPIs such as Total Patients ,Average Length of Stay Per Department , Monthly Medical Expenses Report 

Insights:
• Longest Hospital Stay
• Hospital with the Maximum Medical Expenses 
• Identify the Department with the Lowest Number of Patients 
• Total Patients Treated Per City
